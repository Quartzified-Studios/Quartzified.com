            <h3>1.1 Unauthorized Third-Party Programs and Offensive Behaviour:</h3>
            <p>The Quartzified Studios ("Quartzified") Platform is designed for users to interact in various ways. However, engaging in 'unauthorized' third-party programs for hacking, cheating, botting, and/or altering gameplay, as well as displaying Offensive behaviour, is considered a serious violation of the Quartzified End User License Agreement ("EULA"). An 'unauthorized' third-party program is any third-party software, code, and/or method not expressly authorized by Quartzified. This includes, but is not limited to, any 'add-on' or 'mod' that, in Quartzified's sole determination:</p>
            
            <li>Enables or facilitates cheating, including botting or altering gameplay.</p>
            <li>Permits users to modify or 'hack' a Quartzified game's user interface, environment, and/or experience in ways not expressly allowed by Quartzified in the EULA.</li>
            <li>Intercepts, mines, or otherwise collects information from or through Quartzified games.</li>
            
            <h4>1.2 Penalties for Offenses:</h4>
            <p>Penalties for offenses may include account limitations, particularly for serious offenses.</p>
            
            <h4>1.3 Offensive Behaviour Defined:</h4>
            <p>Offensive behaviour encompasses:</p>
            <li>Language that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, hateful, sexually explicit, LGBTQ-phobic, or otherwise racially or ethnically objectionable. Offensive language in any form of communication is subject to player reports and the decisions and standards of the Quartzified Staff.</li>
            <li>Behaviour involving spam, impersonation, doxing, threats to reveal personal information, threats to reveal someone’s identity, filing false reports (solely to limit someone’s gameplay), real-money trading, or similar actions.</li>
            <li>Cheating in any form, including the use of third-party programs to automate, exploiting bugs within the game, scamming players, sharing accounts, or any activity providing an unfair advantage.</li>
            <li>Multiboxing abuse, where players are allowed to create multiple accounts but are not allowed to gain unfair advantages, such as accelerated wealth generation, exploitation, game rigging, or similar activities.</li>
            
            <h4>1.4 Quartzified Staff Discretion:</h4>
            <p>Offensive behavior is defined and judged at the discretion of Quartzified Staff. Mild cursing, mild insults, and mild multiboxing may be permitted contextually. If unsure about any interaction, language, or behavior, users should reconsider. Quartzified Staff reserves the right to implement necessary limitations and restrictions for an enjoyable player experience.</p>
