            <p>As part of the Quartzified Studios ("Quartzified") Platform, Quartzified provides various tools to allow communication between your characters and the characters of other players. As these communication tools do not constitute an electronic communication service, messages sent using them should not be considered private or personal. So that we can provide a fun, safe and lawful environment for all our players, we have a policy of storing and reviewing both sent and received in-game chats and other messages.</p>

            <p>By accepting this agreement, you agree that Quartzified shall have the right to:</p>
            <li>Store in-game chats and other messages you send or receive on the Quartzified Platform, or through any game that is playable on the Quartzified Platform.</li>
            <li>Review such in-game chats and other messages to investigate potential violations of the law, the Quartzified End User License Agreement, or the Terms of Use agreement specific to any game playable on the Quartzified Platform.</li>

            <p>Quartzified will only use the information contained in the stored in-game chats and other message for investigating and acting on such violations.</p>
